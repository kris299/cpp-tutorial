# cpp-tutorial

## Introduction
The idea behind this project is, to write a simple program as part of my own learning of c++, while refreshing my use of git and github. As I am also new to c++ and this is work in progress, please do not expect some high quality code any time soon.  
So, first and foremost this program is just for myself, but should it prove to be useful to someone else at some point, I would be very glad.

## Goal
The goal of this Tutorial is, to present an interactive learning experience of the c++ programming language for newcomers, while also providing a quick source of reference.

## User-Guide
### Requirements
vim text editor  
g++ compiler  
make  

### Compilation
change into the cloned directory and enter:  
`cd src`  
`make all`  

to test the program enter:  
`./cpp-tutorial` 
#### Restore the programm
Since the program allows and motivates the user to modify its own source, it may happen, that these modifications will not compile. If debbuging is not successful, the program may be restored by entering:  
`make restore`  
To compile the modified code, enter "10" in the main menu, or insert in the terminal:    
`make cpp-tutorial`  
#### Backup user changes
If the user is satisfied with her/his changes, they may be backuped by entering:  
`make backup`

### Installation
